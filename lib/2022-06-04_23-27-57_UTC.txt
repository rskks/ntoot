A. Art.

There is a drawing challenge based on one theme of your choice. The goal is to draw 26 illustrations for each letter of the alphabet. No more requirements: one theme, 26 letters, no time frame. I loved this idea and decided to take this challenge up. Each new letter gives me an opportunity to stretch my imagination and drawing skills. 

However, the biggest challenge of this challenge was to pick a theme. I’ve been going through a lot lately and a series of unfortunate events (👁) happening in my life has helped to decide. “Things that make me happy” is the theme I’ve chosen. I know it’s cheesy but it’s simple and helps me deal with my struggles. 
So occasionally I will post a picture of a thing that makes me happy. 

And how convenient is it that the first letter is A and the word that I’ve picked, of course, is Art. The thing that makes me 100% happy, the reason this account happened in the first place

Let’s do some Art.
